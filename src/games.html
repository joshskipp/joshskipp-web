            <h1 class="section-title">What Game Projects?</h1>
            <p>I do have a strong intrest in video games and game development. In fact, the whole of this page design and layout was inspired by a late online game site, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FunOrb">FunOrb</a>. From the makers of RuneScape, a game that brings many nostalgic feelings.</p>

            <span class="title">So what is the point of this page?</span>
            <p>No point. I don't have anything to show yet. But I have a few ideas of what I can make. When I'm ready to share, you'll find it here.</p>
